# oibsip_task11_Iris_Flower_Classification

Import necessary libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.
Load the Iris Dataset from a CSV file or a URL using Pandas’ read_csv function.
As the CSV file is loaded, see if there are any unnecessary columns that need to be dropped.
Then We Transformed Categorical Data into Numeric Data and cfeated Arrays.
Explore the data by calculating summary statistics and visualizing the data using seaborn or matplotlib.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using Scikit-Learn’s train_test_split function.
Choose a machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Support Vector Machine. In my case I chose K-Nearest Neighbor to train the model.
Train the model on the training set using the fit method of the chosen algorithm.
Make predictions on the testing set using the predict method of the trained model.
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
Fine-tune the model by adjusting its hyperparameters and retraining it on the training set.
Use cross-validation to estimate the model’s performance on unseen data.
Use the trained and fine-tuned model to make predictions on new data.
